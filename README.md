<b>Summary</b>
<p>
    This webapp was created to enable the managers of amateur orchestras/ensembles to have a basic database with contact information and to enable them to send subscription requests to a large amount of contacts for a specific musical project.
    Contacts receive a personalized email containing a URL with which they can subscribe to a project and enter their presence on given rehearsal dates.
    <br/>
    A management-login enables the orchestra managers/coordinators to see who will be present at a given date, view contact information and modify projects and subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
    The system uses Java8, JSF, Primefaces, JPA2 and was created with Netbeans. Currently a <a href='http://inschrijven-vukamerorkest.rhcloud.com/'>simplified version</a> that I made for the <a href='http://vu-kamerorkest.nl/'>VU-Chamber Orchestra</a> is running at Redhat's OpenShift (free!) cloud platform.

    I haven't added a license yet, you're free to use it as you please as long as it does not hurt anyone. For questions, feel free to contact me at <a href='mailto:httpeter@gmail.com'>httpeter@gmail.com</a>.
